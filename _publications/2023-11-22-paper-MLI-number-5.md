excerpt: 'With the continuous emergence of new knowledge, Knowledge Graph (KG) typically suffers from the incompleteness problem, hindering the performance of downstream applications. Thus, Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has attracted considerable attention. However, existing KGC methods usually capture the coarse-grained information by directly interacting with the entity and relation, ignoring the important fine-grained information in them. To capture the fine-grained information, in this paper, we divide each entity/relation into several segments and propose a novel M ulti-Level I nteraction (MLI) based KGC method, which simultaneously interacts with the entity and relation at the fine-grained level and the coarse-grained level. The fine-grained interaction module applies the Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) mechanism to guarantee the sequentiality between segments, which facilitates the fine-grained feature interaction and does not obviously sacrifice the model complexity. Moreover, the coarse-grained interaction module designs a H igh-order F actorized B ilinear (HFB) operation to facilitate the coarse-grained interaction between the entity and relation by applying the tensor factorization based multi-head mechanism, which still effectively reduces its parameter scale. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on the link prediction task over five well-established knowledge graph completion benchmarks.'
